# Adding a New Product in the Database

## Project Description

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new products. A MySQL database will be created to store product data. The form data will be validated, and a row will be added to the database. All database processing will be done using Hibernate.

As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to create a database table for storing product information. A form is needed to add new products. The form submission is validated, and a new record is created in the product table.

## Technologies Used

- Eclipse as the IDE
- Apache Tomcat as the web server
- JSP pages for the front end
- Servlets for backend processing
- Hibernate to store data into the database

## Requirements

- Show an add product form in JSP
- Handle the form submission in a servlet. Validate it for any missing information
- Add the product information into the database using Hibernate
- Set up Hibernate configuration files using XML for the product table
- A class has to be created to store product data. This class will be linked to Hibernate via an hbm.xml file
- The servlet will put the form data into the product class and then pass the product class into Hibernate to add into the database
- The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
